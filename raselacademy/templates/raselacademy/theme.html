        HTML let you help to create tables, Tables are something with row and coloum. If we want to create table You should use <xmp> <table> tag </xmp>. HTML tables can contain many tags but we will focus on some features. <xmp> <table> <tr> <th> <td> </th></td></tr> </xmp>.

Look some basic tables structure. <xmp> <table> <tr> <th> This is table</th> </tr></table> </xmp>.
